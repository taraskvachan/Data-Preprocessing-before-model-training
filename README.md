# Data-Preprocessing-before-model-training

## Project description

In this project, we focused on data preprocessing to prepare datasets for machine learning models. We performed essential steps such as data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), handling missing values, treating outliers, and encoding categorical variables. 

We visualized data distributions with histograms, box plots, and correlation heatmaps to identify patterns and relationships. 

Additionally, we applied techniques like mode, median, and KNNImputer for missing value treatment and addressed outliers to improve model performance.
